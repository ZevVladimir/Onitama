# Onitama
Recreating the game Onitama

RULES:
Blue goes first
Each player gets two cards (blue the bottom two, red the top two) the one in the middle no one can use
You can only use the moves indicated on your cards
You click on the card you want to use then click on the piece you want to use it with
Then click on which highlighted square you want to move to
The card you used is then cycled to the middle and you get the middle card
This repeats for the other player
You win by taking the other player's master (the square piece) or by landing on the other player's dojo (the yellow square)

Incorporates all cards except dragon. Allows for two people to play on same device. Highlight moves depending on what card and piece are chosen.
Trying to improve python skills and create a fun game. 
Using pygame

What would make it nicer
-Resizeable screen
-Better UI 
-Restart game/new game
-Show which card is chosen
-Show whose turn it is
-Tutorial/explanation in game
