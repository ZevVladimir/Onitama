# Onitama
Recreating the game Onitama
Incorporates all cards except dragon. Allows for two people to play on same device. Highlight moves depending on what card and piece are chosen.
Trying to improve python skills and create relatively simple game. 
Using pygame

What would make it nicer
-Resizeable screen
-Better UI 
-Restart game/new game
-Show which card is chosen
-Show whose turn it is
