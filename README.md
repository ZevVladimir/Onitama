# Onitama
Recreating the game Onitama
Incorporates all cards except dragon. Allows for two people to play on same device. Highlight moves depending on what card and piece are chosen.
Trying to improve python skills and create relatively simple game. 
Using pygame

What would make it nicer
Better UI: restart game/new game, win game screen, show which card is chosen, show whose turn it is
